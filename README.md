# IPEO_Project_Group_4
Large Rock Detection



### Instructions:
1. Keep the folders:
   - `swissImage_50cm...`
   - `swissSURFACE3D_hillschade...`
   - `swissSURFACE3D_patches`
   
   **inside** the `IPEO_PROJECT_GROUP_4` directory.
   
2. I used this folder structure to read the images, just so that we dont have any confusion
